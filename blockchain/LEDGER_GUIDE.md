# LP Locker - Ledger Hardware Wallet Integration

This guide explains how to use your Ledger hardware wallet to interact with the LP Locker smart contract safely and securely.

## Two Integration Approaches

We provide **two different approaches** for Ledger integration:

### 1. Foundry Native (Simple)
- **Command**: `make ledger-interact`
- **Technology**: Foundry's built-in `--ledger` support
- **Best for**: Development, testing, simple operations
- **Setup**: Minimal - just connect Ledger and run
- **Documentation**: This guide

### 2. Geth + Clef (Robust)
- **Command**: `make ledger-clef`  
- **Technology**: Geth's Clef signing service
- **Best for**: Production use, automated operations, advanced features
- **Setup**: Requires Geth installation
- **Documentation**: [LEDGER_CLEF_GUIDE.md](./LEDGER_CLEF_GUIDE.md)

**Quick Decision Guide:**
- üöÄ **Just want to try it?** ‚Üí Use `make ledger-interact`
- üèóÔ∏è **Building production systems?** ‚Üí Use `make ledger-clef`
- üîß **Need auto-approval rules?** ‚Üí Use `make ledger-clef`
- üêõ **Having connection issues with Foundry?** ‚Üí Try `make ledger-clef`

## Foundry Native Integration (This Guide)

This guide covers the Foundry-based approach using `make ledger-interact`.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
1. **Ledger Device**: Nano S, Nano S Plus, Nano X, or Ledger Stax
2. **USB Connection**: Stable USB connection to your computer (USB-C for Stax)
3. **Latest Firmware**: Ensure your Ledger has the latest firmware

### Software Requirements
1. **Ethereum App**: Installed on your Ledger device
2. **Foundry**: Cast and Forge tools installed
3. **Environment Setup**: Properly configured `.env` file

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Ledger Device Setup

1. **Connect your Ledger** to your computer via USB (USB-C for Stax)
2. **Unlock your device** with your PIN
3. **Open the Ethereum app** on your Ledger
4. **Enable Contract Data** in Ethereum app settings:
   - Navigate to Settings in the Ethereum app
   - Enable "Contract data"
   - Enable "Debug data" (optional, for better transaction details)

**For Ledger Stax users:**
- The large touchscreen will display transaction details more clearly
- Contract data and function calls will be easier to read and verify
- Touch navigation makes confirming transactions more intuitive
- The device may show additional context about the contract interaction

### 2. Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Update the `.env` file with the correct contract addresses:

```bash
# Deployed LP Locker contract address
LP_LOCKER_ADDRESS=0x09635F643e140090A9A8Dcd712eD6285858ceBef

# Aerodrome LP token contract address  
LP_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0xa85233C63b9Ee964Add6F2cffe00Fd84eb32338f
```

### 3. Test Ledger Connection

```bash
make ledger-check
```

This command will:
- Test connection to your Ledger device
- Display your Ledger's Ethereum address
- Verify the device is properly configured

- **Carefully review** all transaction data on your Ledger screen:
  - Contract address
  - Function being called
  - Parameters (amounts, addresses, etc.)
  - Gas settings

### 4. Transaction Broadcast
- After Ledger confirmation, transaction is broadcast to the network
- You'll see transaction hash and status

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Always Verify on Ledger
- **Never** approve transactions without carefully reading the Ledger screen
- **Double-check** all addresses and amounts on the device
- **Verify** the contract address matches the expected LP Locker

### 2. Network Selection
- **Confirm** you're on the correct network (Anvil Local vs Base Mainnet)
- **Double-check** contract addresses for the selected network

### 3. Amount Verification
- **Review** all amounts carefully (in wei and formatted units)
- **Ensure** you have sufficient balance for transactions + gas fees
- **Check** allowances before locking or topping up

### 4. Lock ID Management
- **Keep track** of your lock IDs for future reference
- **Use** the view functions to verify lock details before operations
- **Copy/paste** lock IDs to avoid typos (they're long hex strings)

### 5. Fee Operations
- **Fee Claiming**: Anyone can claim fees, but they always go to the designated fee receiver
- **Fee Updates**: Anyone can update fee tracking to ensure accurate calculations  
- **Fee Receiver**: Only the contract owner can change where fees are sent
- **Update** fees before claiming to get the most recent amounts
- **Verify** fee amounts before claiming

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Could not connect to Ledger"
- **Solution**: Ensure Ledger is connected, unlocked, and Ethereum app is open
- **Check**: Contract data is enabled in Ethereum app settings
- **Try**: Unplugging and reconnecting the Ledger
- **For Stax**: Ensure USB-C cable supports data transfer (not just charging)
- **For Stax**: Try different USB-C ports if connection issues persist

#### "Transaction failed" 
- **Check**: Sufficient ETH balance for gas fees
- **Verify**: Correct network selection
- **Ensure**: Required approvals are in place for token operations

#### "Invalid Lock ID"
- **Solution**: Use `View Contract State` to get valid lock IDs
- **Format**: Lock IDs should be 32-byte hex strings starting with 0x

#### "Insufficient allowance"
- **Solution**: Run `Approve LP Tokens` with sufficient amount before locking
- **Check**: Current allowance with `View Contract State`

#### "Withdrawal not triggered" or "Still in time lock"
- **Solution**: Use `Trigger Withdrawal` first, then wait 30 days
- **Check**: Current lock status with `View Lock Details`

### Getting Help

1. **Check this guide** for common solutions
2. **Review error messages** carefully - they often indicate the exact issue
3. **Use view functions** to understand current contract state
4. **Verify** all prerequisites are met for the desired action

## Network Information

## Example Workflow

### Creating Your First Lock

1. **Check balances**:
   ```bash
   make ledger-view-state
   ```

2. **Approve tokens** (if needed):
   ```bash
   make ledger-approve
   # Enter: 100 (for 100 LP tokens)
   ```

3. **Lock liquidity**:
   ```bash
   make ledger-lock
   # Enter: 50 (to lock 50 LP tokens)
   ```

4. **View your new lock**:
   ```bash
   make ledger-view-state
   # Note the Lock ID for future reference
   ```

### Claiming Fees (Owner Only)

1. **Update fees**:
   ```bash
   make ledger-interact
   # Choose: 10) Update Fees
   # Enter your Lock ID
   ```

2. **Claim fees**:
   ```bash
   make ledger-claim
   # Enter your Lock ID
   ```

Remember: Only the contract owner can claim fees. Regular users can only manage their locks.
